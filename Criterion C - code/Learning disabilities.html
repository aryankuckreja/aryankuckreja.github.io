    <u><h2>What are Learning Disabilities and Why is it Important to consider?</h2></u>
    <p>Learning disabilities are due to genetic and/or neurobiological factors that alter brain functioning in a manner which affects one or more cognitive processes related to learning. These processing problems can interfere with learning basic skills such as reading, writing and/or math.</p>
    <p>They can also interfere with higher level skills such as organization, time planning, abstract reasoning, long or short term memory and attention.  It is important to realize that learning disabilities can affect an individual’s life beyond academics and can impact relationships with family, friends and in the workplace.</p>
    <p>Learning Disabilities affect the way a person processes information and thus how they learn information. Simply put, their brains are wired differently. Learning Disabilities are common and affect approximately 5 - 15% of young people around the world. They are considered an “invisible disability”</p>
